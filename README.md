# Genetic algorithm in search of protein conformation in a FCC lattice. 
The HP model reduces all 20 amino acids with a binary question: is the amino acid hydrophobic or not? Then represents the amino acids in a 2D or 3D lattice. The free energy of a conformation is as low as the number of noncovalent contacts (a HH contact) between two amino acids that are adjacent in space but not in sequence. Although this is a greatly simplification of the mechanics of protein folding, it is helpful in understanding the basics principles of the mechanism and it still constitutes a NP-hard problem both in 2D and 3D. This problem has been subject to many approaches, such as ions motion optimization, CSP and many others. Genetic algorithms have also been chosen to tackle this problem by some authors before and is the method choosen by this project.
